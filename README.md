Steem HF20 made it incredibly easy to open a new account if you have enough RC. Before this Steemit Inc was the main account creation service along with @blocktrades and @anonsteem. All of these services set their account as recovery account of the newly created or purchased account and offer recovery in case of hacking or forgetting latest password.

But if you open an account using SteemConnect or using API and now using claimed account tokens, your account will be set us recovery account of the new account. Now if owner of the new account lost its latest master password or become victim or hacking, you have to issue recovery request as you are the trustee account. There is no easy GUI for it, so I made one.
